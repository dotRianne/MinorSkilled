# MinorSkilled
Github environment for MinorSkilled subject | 2025-2026 Semester 1 | Rianne Jongerius

During Minor Skilled I want to put a heavy focus on Level Design, World Design and UI/UX. With my base level of UI/UX already being higher than the other two I want to further develop this skill to a level where I can use it to apply for internships. Level Design and World Design are parts of game design I love the most and want to further develop my skills for to further enhance my ability as an allrounder. Taking inspiration from existing games such as Biped and Little Kitty Big City I want to create a small world in which the user is able to freely move around and "interact" with the world. NPCs will be placed around the world which need help, after which the user is sent to a temporary dimension where via different designs a puzzle of sorts is laid out for the user to complete. I believe with the right structure I have good self-discipline, the most important factor for me is a stable environment in which I can work. I have already talked plans with people to ensure this will happen as planned.
